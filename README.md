messaging for Lumias with WoA

this is a bare-bones messaging app.

Whats's working:

* You can view message threads
* you can reply to message threads
* you can send a new text message (buggy)

Whats not working:

* replies cant be saved to device (issue with MessageStore)
* no notification support/new chats dont show up in conversation view (use inbuilt messaging app for notifications)
